        ===========================
        
        Google Cloud Storage file backend for Django
        
        If you run your projects on Google's appengine and you are using the django framework you might need this
        file backend since there is no way to upload files, images, etc on appengine. Although solutions exist for
        the amazon cloud storage i have not found a file backend for google cloud storage. This backend does work
        with google cloud storage, although in early development. I have used it with regular file uploads and with
        file manager solutions such as django-filer. The code as it is right now stores files for public use (i.e. a web site's images)
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        You need to have an appengine project. This will not work as a standalone solution for non appengine django projects, since there is no authentication mechanism with the google cloud storage implemented.
        
        
        ### If you want to copy the files into your repository.
        
        You need to install the GCS client library from
        https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/googlecloudstorageclient/download.
        
        Just run `pip install GoogleAppEngineCloudStorageClient -t <your_app_directory/lib>`, or optionally, unzip the file and copy the `src/cloudstorage` folder into your project directory.
        
        Installation
        -------------
        
        ```
        pip install django-google-cloud-storage
        ```
        
        Or Just copy the google folder in your project directory
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        On your django settings.py file you need to add the following settings
        
            GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET = '/your_bucket_name' # the name of the bucket you have created from the google cloud storage console
            GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_URL = 'http://storage.googleapis.com/bucket' #whatever the ulr for accessing your cloud storgage bucket
            GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_DEFAULT_CACHE_CONTROL = 'public, max-age: 7200' # default cache control headers for your files
        
        And finally declare the file storage backend you will use on your settings.py file
        
            DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'django_google_cloud_storage.GoogleCloudStorage'
